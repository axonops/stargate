# CONTAINS Operation Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of CONTAINS operations for the Document API with Cassandra 5.0 SAI.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Components

1. **ContainsFilterOperation** (`filter/operation/impl/ContainsFilterOperation.java`)
   - Implements the filter operation for CONTAINS matching
   - Returns EQ predicate for database queries (matches exact values in array elements)
   - NOTE: NOT CONTAINS is not supported as it's not available in Cassandra 5.0

2. **ContainsCondition** (`condition/impl/ContainsCondition.java`)
   - Core condition implementation for CONTAINS operations
   - Handles value type detection (string, number, boolean)
   - Generates appropriate CQL for array element matching

3. **ContainsConditionProvider** (`condition/provider/impl/ContainsConditionProvider.java`)
   - Creates ContainsCondition instances from JSON nodes
   - Supports all primitive value types
   - Throws error if negated parameter is true (NOT CONTAINS not supported)

4. **FilterOperationCode Updates**
   - Added `CONTAINS("$contains")` to enum
   - NOT_CONTAINS was not added as it's not supported in Cassandra 5.0

## How It Works

### Data Model
In the Document API, arrays are stored as individual rows with array indices in the path:
```
Document: { "tags": ["javascript", "nodejs", "react"] }

Stored as:
- Row 1: path=tags[000000], string_value=javascript
- Row 2: path=tags[000001], string_value=nodejs  
- Row 3: path=tags[000002], string_value=react
```

### Query Execution
For a CONTAINS query like `{ "tags": { "$contains": "javascript" } }`:

1. **Database Query**: 
   - Generates: `SELECT * FROM table WHERE string_value = 'javascript'`
   - This efficiently finds all rows with the target value

2. **In-Memory Filtering**:
   - The results are then filtered to ensure the matching rows belong to array elements
   - Path validation ensures the row is part of the correct array field

### Limitations

1. **Path Matching**: The current implementation has a limitation - it generates queries that match values across ALL fields, not just the target array. Additional filtering logic is needed to ensure matches come from the correct array field.

2. **NOT CONTAINS**: Not supported in Cassandra 5.0 and therefore not implemented

3. **Performance**: Without proper path constraints in the CQL query, CONTAINS may return more rows than necessary, requiring additional in-memory filtering

## Usage Examples

```json
// Find documents where tags array contains "javascript"
{
  "tags": { "$contains": "javascript" }
}

// Find documents where scores array contains the number 95
{
  "scores": { "$contains": 95 }
}

// Find documents where flags array contains true
{
  "flags": { "$contains": true }
}
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Path-Aware Queries**: Modify the query generation to include path constraints:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM table 
   WHERE p0 = 'tags' 
   AND p1 LIKE '[%]'  -- Array index pattern
   AND string_value = 'javascript'
   ```

2. **SAI Collection Support**: When Cassandra adds native collection indexing support, update to use it

3. **Query Optimization**: Add query planning to choose between different execution strategies

## Testing
- Unit tests needed for all components
- Integration tests needed for end-to-end validation
- Performance tests needed to validate efficiency with large arrays
